					The inexorable growth of the world's population and the concomitant
					surge in energy requirements pose a formidable challenge to
					policymakers, scientists, and industry leaders worldwide. Fossil
					fuels, our main source of energy, is unsustainable both in terms of
					its supply as well as its environmental impact, necessitating the
					search for sustainable alternatives. While renewable energy sources,
					typified by wind and solar power, have made significant inroads in
					addressing these challenges, there persist obstacles related to energy
					storage capabilities and energy conversion efficiencies. This research
					project aims to scrutinize tidal wave energy harvesting, positioning
					it as a promising alternative with unique attributes. In order to do
					this, this study will identify suitable locations for tidal harvesting
					systems across the world considering the generated wave energy,
					geopolitical regional standards, ecological impact along with other
					factors.

				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>
					The project involves collecting geopolitical data on renewable energy
					policies and incentives, ecological data related to potential impacts,
					and wave data from reliable sources. These datasets are then
					integrated using geographic coordinates, normalized, and processed.
					Statistical and machine learning techniques are applied to assess
					correlations and feasibility. The findings are visualized in a
					user-friendly GIS-based map with interactive features. Ethical
					considerations and data quality are maintained throughout the process
					to ensure a robust and reliable analysis.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<u>Feasibility: </u>Determining the most feasible locations based on
						a combination of government support, minimal ecological impact, and
						high wave energy potential. Visual Representation: The map should
						offer clear and insightful visuals that aid decision-making
						regarding suitable locations for wave energy farms.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>Usability: </u>Ensure the visualization tool is user-friendly,
						allowing stakeholders to interact with and comprehend the data
						easily.
					</li>
					<li>
						<u>Scalability: </u>Design the system in a way that it can
						accommodate additional data and analysis in the future, enabling
						ongoing improvements and updates.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					By implementing these steps, the project will systematically evaluate
					and visualize potential wave energy farm locations globally,
					considering geopolitical, ecological, and wave data for a
					comprehensive assessment of suitability.

				<h2>Innovations</h2>
				<p>
					There are several innovations associated with the approaches taken in
					this project. This first innovation from this project is the
					comprehensive, holistic evaluation rubric that will be used to
					determine the optimal wave harvesting locations. Currently, there are
					no such evaluation methods that consider factors outside of optimal
					wave locations when deciding on harvesting locations. Based on
					literature reviews, some of the major hindrances for wave energy
					adoption include regional policies, funding and impacts to the
					ecological environment. Hence, in order to fully understand if an area
					is suitable for wave energy harvesting, it is necessary to consider
					these factors. Our approach will evaluate tidal wave energy by
					robustly analyzing its temporal reliability with respect to its power
					generation, power and energy differential, consistency, distance to
					nearby towns and cities, and potential influence on marine life. We
					will score each location on its tidal wave energy project suitability.
					Research suggests holistically evaluating different factors that
					affect and predict tidal energy systems will lead to more successful
					deployments.
				</p>

					The second innovation is tracking temporal wave variability, with a
					particular emphasis on seasonal changes. While the customary focus has
					been directed towards the spatial attributes of wave energy resources,
					the temporal changes inherent in wave patterns have often been
					overlooked. Understanding and integrating temporal wave variability,
					especially on a seasonal basis, is crucial for advancing the
					feasibility and efficiency of wave energy harvesting systems. This
					innovation introduces the concept of developing a Temporal Wave
					Analysis Framework (TWAF) to systematically evaluate and account for
					the seasonal temporal changes in wave energy, thereby enriching the
					wave farm feasibility assessments. The TWAF encompasses a data
					analysis tool that meticulously monitors, analyzes, and forecasts wave
					patterns over time, with a keen focus on seasonal variations. By doing
					so, it provides a nuanced understanding of how wave energy potential
					varies across different seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
					This understanding is pivotal as it directly impacts the energy output
					and reliability of wave energy harvesting systems. Furthermore it aids
					in optimizing the design and operation of wave energy converters to
					better match the energy supply with demand. This seasonal analysis
					facilitates a more accurate estimation of the Return on Investment
					(ROI) for wave energy projects by offering a clearer picture of the
					energy production over the project lifespan. The temporal analysis of
					wave energy on a seasonal basis also holds implications for grid
					integration and energy storage solutions. By having a comprehensive
					understanding of the seasonal wave dynamics, better strategies for
					energy storage and grid integration can be devised to ensure a steady
					power supply even during periods of low wave activity, which are often
					seasonally influenced. Utilizing NDBC buoy data, we're enhancing our
					visual map with a slicer functionality. This allows users to analyze
					temporal wave variability over selected time frames and seasons
					effortlessly. By slicing through the data interactively, users can
					uncover trends in wave energy crucial for informed decision-making in
					wave energy projects. This integration transforms our visual map into
					a potent tool for deriving actionable insights from raw wave data,
					propelling the advancement of wave energy harvesting initiatives.
